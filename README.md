## Contributing and getting help :speech_balloon: :beers:

Contributions, suggestions, and questions are welcome! If you are interested in developing, my recommendation is going to be to use the Devcontainer (even if you don't like them) as it has everything setup already to run the tests or to just let Github actions run the tests. I'll review prs and respond to issues/discussion here on GitHub but if you want more synchronous communication you can find me in the [effect discord](https://discord.gg/effect-ts) as @leonitous
